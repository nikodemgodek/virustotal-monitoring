# Directory monitoring integrated with VirusTotal

Hi, thanks for watching this repository!

## About project
This project is a Java-based application developed using Spring Boot. The application enables real-time monitoring of a specified directory on a Windows system, tracking all file changes including additions, deletions, and modifications. Additionally, it integrates with the VirusTotal API to provide enhanced security. Whenever a file with a suspicious hash is detected, the application will automatically flag it and notify the user, ensuring proactive monitoring and threat detection.
